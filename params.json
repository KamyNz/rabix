You can run pipelines, but can't (easily) make them yet.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nFirst, [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation) on a linux machine.\r\n \r\nSecond, install rabix via pip:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/rabix/rabix@devel\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck if everything works by installing an example pipeline:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rabix install https://s3.amazonaws.com/boysha/pipeline_test_bwa_freebayes.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"install\" command simply pre-fetches referenced docker images.\r\nIf you don't want to download hundreds of megabytes, you can just attempt to run the pipeline,\r\nwhich should fetch only the JSON files and present you with input options:\r\n \r\n```\r\n$ rabix run https://s3.amazonaws.com/boysha/pipeline_test_bwa_freebayes.json \r\n```\r\n\r\nOptionally, run the pipeline with some example data. It won't take long:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rabix run https://s3.amazonaws.com/boysha/pipeline_test_bwa_freebayes.json \\\r\n  --reference https://s3.amazonaws.com/boysha/testfiles/example_human_reference.fasta \\\r\n  --read https://s3.amazonaws.com/boysha/testfiles/example_human_Illumina.pe_1.fastq \\\r\n  --read https://s3.amazonaws.com/boysha/testfiles/example_human_Illumina.pe_2.fastq\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
