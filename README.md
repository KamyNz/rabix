# Reproducable Analytic for Bio-Informatics

This project aims to solve a problem of reproducing complex computational analytics that often occurs in bio-informatics. Reproducable experimental findings is one of the underpinnings of scientific method. As experiments grow dependent on computational methods, ensuring that other teams can replicate results, asks for robust approach to describing steps and preconditions of relevant analysis.


## How its done

There are two main components of the project: specification and a Docker-based Python implementation. Specification defines a format for describing tools and computation, and a runtime protocol.

## How to contribute

Master branch is reserved for releases and `devel` branch is used for ongoing development. You should create topic branches off `devel` branch.
