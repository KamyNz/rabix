# Reproducable Analytic for Bio-Informatics
 
This project aims to solve a problem of reproducing complex computational analytics that often occurs in bio-informatics. Reproducing experimental findings is one of the underpinnings of scientific method. As experiments grow dependent on computational methods, ensuring that other teams can replicate results asks for robust approach to describing steps and preconditions of relevant analysis.
