## Reproducible Analyses for Bioinformatics 

The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to package and distribute tools and pipelines using Docker images.
There are three main components:

* Format and protocol specification.
* Tools to run apps and pipelines.
* An SDK to easily package tools and pipelines into reusable components.

Note that this project is still under development. You can run pipelines, but can't (easily) make them yet.
